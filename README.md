# <Weather-Dashboard>

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to create something where someone can easily check the weather (temperature, weather, wind speed and humidity)for today & also the next 5 days for any city. I built this project to help people that may need another option to check the weather in different cities. It can solve any problems someone may have whether their apps on their phones or other devices are not working at the moment & need a quick fix to check the weather in any city. I learned more about using API keys & how to use them further.
